            I've made my home base in Province, Rhode Island with my small
            growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in
            journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated
            with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and
            wanted to learn how to build my own site to find my own specific
            needs.

            That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I
            learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something
            that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my
            work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end-development, where I
            can use my organization skills and eye for details to write clean,
            elegant code.
