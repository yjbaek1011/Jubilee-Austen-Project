              I've made my home base in Province, Rhode Island with my small
              growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in
              journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was
              fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was
              hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to find my own
              specific needs.

              That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I
              learned how to build my first website, I realized I found
              something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking
              for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to
              front-end-development, where I can use my organization skills and
              eye for details to write clean, elegant code.
